"	Validator ignoring MaxLength attributes	c#	c#	"Problem:
I am trying to manually Validate some c# objects, and the Validator is ignoring string length related validations.

Test Case:
extending this example which uses the [Required] attribute, i also wanted to validate that strings were not too long, as follows.

public class Recipe
{
    //[Required]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [MaxLength(1)] public string difficulty = ""a_string_that_is_too_long"";

public static void Main(string[] args)
{

    var recipe = new Recipe();
    var context = new ValidationContext(recipe, serviceProvider: null, items: null);
    var results = new List<ValidationResult>();

    var isValid = Validator.TryValidateObject(recipe, context, results);

    if (!isValid)
    {
        foreach (var validationResult in results)

<p>I've spent way too long trying to resolve this and I suspect the answer is to stop trying to do it this way.

Instead I need to inject some form of service that allows me to derive IPrincipal when one of the methods in the decorator is called, e.g. <code>Func&lt;IPrincipal&gt;</code>. Nancy provides an override-able method <code>ConfigureRequestContainer()</code> that is called for each request, so could potentially be used:</p>

<p>Actually no, <code>nancy</code> is not the same container as the request container. So maybe somewhere there is a container that can successfully resolve IPrincipal but I do not know how to access it.

This compiles and runs fine with output:

0
99
1
101
2


I get the same output with or without extern in the original count.h file. So what am I missing in the answer? 

Now, I thought the answer is that ""I'm just declaring multiple copies of count"" since there are no header guards, and that is OK because multiple declarations are OK, whereas multiple definitions are not. 
But then if that's the case, I would expect the following to compile, but it does not since I am ""redefining count."" 

int main(){
   int count;
   int count; 
   int count = 0;
}


According to this answer, int count does count as a definition.

This error occurs only at times but I am unable to figure out why it happens although the CSV has all the 10 tweets written into it every time the entire code is refreshed. 
Also, if I run the code once more, the error disappears and the webpage loads without any issues with the tweets, surprisingly!

What am I missing?
Any help is much appreciated! Thanks!

<p>Is there a <em>shortcut</em> one can take to find the set of all faces visible to the camera at a given time?

<p>I'd be very grateful for any ideas others can offer on this question!</p>

<p><strong>Better than O(n)?</strong></p>

<p>Given a sorted array of integers I believe one can determine the subset of those integers that line between an upper and lower bound in ~O(log(n)). Each face's geometric mean is a 3d point, so it seems possible to determine the set of points within the frustum with 3*O(log(n)), i.e. better than O(n) complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Better than O(log(n))</strong></p>

<p>An approximation better than O(log(n)) after some precomputing. Suppose we're dealing with only 1D (then we can generalize to 3D). Quantize the space of each axis then create a hash table with the following structure. For each unit in the quantized space, store the index position of the first point in the sorted array with that unit +- error value. Then given an upper and lower bound, round each to the nearest quantized unit and look up the values for those keys to identify the range of index positions within the span. This returns a list. Repeat for the other two dimensions and take the set intersection. [The frustum provides the upper and lower bounds for each dimension.]</p>

console.log( frustum.intersectsBox( meshes[0].geometry.vertices[0] ) );


Is there a shortcut one can take to find the set of all faces visible to the camera at a given time? In my case, I could precompute the geometric mean of each planar face then use the code above to determine which of the faces is visible, but is there anything better than O(n) in this case?

I'd be very grateful for any ideas others can offer on this question!

Better than O(n)?

Given a sorted array of integers I believe one can determine the subset of those integers that line between an upper and lower bound in ~O(log(n)). Each face's geometric mean is a 3d point, so it seems possible to determine the set of points within the frustum with 3*O(log(n)), i.e. better than O(n) complexity.

Better than O(log(n))

An approximation better than O(log(n)) after some precomputing. Suppose we're dealing with only 1D (then we can generalize to 3D). Quantize the space of each axis then create a hash table with the following structure. For each unit in the quantized space, store the index position of the first point in the sorted array with that unit +- error value. Then given an upper and lower bound, round each to the nearest quantized unit and look up the values for those keys to identify the range of index positions within the span. This returns a list. Repeat for the other two dimensions and take the set intersection. [The frustum provides the upper and lower bounds for each dimension.]

"	Creating a border animation on circle	jquery|css|svg	jquery css	"
  I want to animate the middle circle's borders to start off with nothing and rotate to complete the circle (classes .cir3 & .cir4) almost like a spinner(page loader) without the repeating.


Fiddle 

I changed them to black so they are easy to identify.

Here is a close example(bottom row) of what I'm looking for except I want it to complete the circle and not repeat like this

I just need someone to point me the right direction.
JS Fiddle is Cleaner code.

Picture to show the issue

Instead of using SKCropNode, I will programmatically create a UIImage with a hole at the right position and render it as a texture of a SKSpriteNode. I have implemented the feature by init a SKSpriteNode with the created UIImage:

-(instancetype)init{
    CGRect rect = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.size.width, self.size.height);
    CGRect spotLightRect = CGRectMake(100,100,200,200); // adjust this as desired!
    UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(rect.size, NO, 0);
    CGContextRef c = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();
    UIColor*bColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0 green:0.0 blue:0 alpha:0.5];
    CGContextSetFillColorWithColor(c, bColor.CGColor);
    CGContextFillRect(c, rect); //the mask
    UIColor*aColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0 green:0.0 blue:0 alpha:1];
    CGContextSetFillColorWithColor(c, aColor.CGColor);
    CGContextSetBlendMode(c, kCGBlendModeClear);

Create a new class called <code>BrideService</code> that extends <code>AccountService</code> and calls <code>super.createAccount()</code>? So then I need a command object that has that extra field in it now, too? And then the validator needs to deal with the extra field, so I inherit from the <code>AccountValidator</code> class? As you can see, I get this slippery slope of messy, inherited classes that only serve the purpose of adding one or two fields' logic to all the classes that should be able to handle them generically at some point. I mean, that's the purpose of polymorphism, right? So that I can use <code>Account</code> all over the place and the services, etc. ""just work?"" Is there somewhere in this tangled mess that the adapter pattern would work? Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>
"	How to handle inheritance of Spring Beans in MVC projects	java|spring|spring-mvc|inheritance|spring-boot	java	"I have a project with many inter-dependent pieces:

myProject
  - core
  - core_web (depends on core)
  - app1_core (depends on core)
  - app1_web (depends on app1_core and core_web)
  - app2_core (depends on core)
  - app2_web (depends on app2_core and core_web)


I have the typical MVC pieces defined in core and core_web: services, controllers, repositories, JPA entities, etc.

The app1 project uses all this core stuff as-is--there are no additional pieces except for some specific configuration with application.properties that I will be able to work out with some @Configuration magic.

The app2 project, however, adds a Date field and a List field to an entity. The effect of the addition cascades everywhere: DTOs, factories, controllers, services, etc. become a muddle inheritance mess that just feels icky from a design perspective. Is there a better, DRY-er, more best-practice-y way of handling this, or am I just going to have to inherit nearly every class from my core code just to add a couple fields to an entity?

As a simple example (using Lombok here for brevity and awesomeness), here's an @Entity from core:

package com.example.core;

@Data
@Entity
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Table(name = ""ACCOUNT"")
@ToString(of = {""id"", ""emailAddress"", ""name""})
@EqualsAndHashCode
public class Account implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Embedded
    private Address address;

    @Id
    @GenericGenerator(
            name = ""SEQ_ACCOUNT_ID"",
            strategy = ""org.hibernate.id.enhanced.SequenceStyleGenerator"",
            parameters = {
                    @Parameter(name = ""sequence_name"", value = ""SEQ_ACCOUNT_ID""),
                    @Parameter(name = ""initial_value"", value = ""1""),
                    @Parameter(name = ""increment_size"", value = ""1"")
            }
    )
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = ""SEQ_ACCOUNT_ID"")
    @Column(name = ""ACCOUNT_ID"", updatable = false, nullable = false, unique = true)
    private Long id;

    @Column(name = ""EMAIL"", nullable = false, length = 200, unique = true)
    private String emailAddress;

    public void setEmailAddress(String emailAddress) {
        this.emailAddress = StringUtils.lowerCase(emailAddress);
    }

    @JsonIgnore
    @Column(name = ""PASSWORD_HASH"", nullable = false, length = 256)
    private String passwordHash;

    @Column(name = ""NAME"", nullable = false, length = 200)
    private String name;

    @Column(name = ""PHONE"", nullable = false, length = 30)
    private String phoneNumber;

    @Column(name = ""URL"")
    private String url;
}


Now I add the extra field in app2

package com.example.app2;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@Table(name = ""ACCOUNT"")
@ToString(callSuper = true)
@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = true)
public class Bride extends Account {
    @Column(name = ""WEDDING_DATE"")
    private Date weddingDate;
}


I expect this amount of work. It's decent, elegant, doesn't duplicate much, and as long as I tell Spring not to scan both classes for entities, it's all good. Where it starts getting tedious is when I start adding service code, for example:

package com.example.core;

@Service
public class AccountService {

    private AccountRepository accountRepository;

    @Autowired
    public AccountService(AccountRepository accountRepository) {
        this.accountRepository = accountRepository;
    }

    /* the command object here would mirror Account, but contain some code
     * to handle input validation and the like. I know I could just use the
     * entity class, but I've been bitten by using entity classes as DTOs or
     * command objects before, so I'd like to keep them separate.
     */
    public Account createAccount(CreateAccountCommand createAccountCommand) {
        Account account = new Account();
        account.setEmailAddress(createAccountCommand.getEmailAddress());
        account.setPasswordHash(createPasswordHash(createAccountCommand.getPassword()));
        account.setName(createAccountCommand.getName());
        account.setPhoneNumber(createAccountCommand.getPhoneNumber());
        account.setUrl(createAccountCommand.getUrl());
    }
}


Now the main question: How do (read: should) I deal with the extra field in Bride? Create a new class called BrideService that extends AccountService and calls super.createAccount()? So then I need a command object that has that extra field in it now, too? And then the validator needs to deal with the extra field, so I inherit from the AccountValidator class?

"<p>Let consider a simple use of <code>map()</code> function in JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>[1,2].map(x =&gt; x + 1).map(x =&gt; x + 2); // [3,4]
</code></pre>

<p>I am wondering whether each of arrow function calls is executed in separate loops or if the functions are applied to array elements in one loop. I know that for example in java those function would be executed in one loop (using Streams from Java 8). In that case we can chain some functions that are non-terminal (they return Stream on which we can call another function) but those operations are not executed until we use a terminal function (like <code>collect()</code> that transforms Stream into some collection, like an array). Thus, all the operations (maps, filters etc.) are merged so that all of them can run in one loop.</p>

<p>On the other hand we have a JavaScript where we know that <code>Array.prototype.map()</code> returns another array, so it seems like each <code>map()</code> call is executed in separate loop. But that would be quite a waste of execution time! The simplest answer is that it's all optimized by engine so the functions are indeed executed in one loop, but I couldn't find any information that this is the case.</p>

<p>A side question - can we say that Java's <code>Stream</code> is a functor? It seems like it is - it has a map function that transforms collection to same-size collection and returns a stream. But on the other hand, as mentioned before, this map function does not in fact modify anything until we call some terminal function.</p>
"	When chaining map functions - are they executed in one loop?	javascript|functional-programming|functor	javascript	"Let consider a simple use of map() function in JavaScript:

[1,2].map(x => x + 1).map(x => x + 2); // [3,4]


I am wondering whether each of arrow function calls is executed in separate loops or if the functions are applied to array elements in one loop. I know that for example in java those function would be executed in one loop (using Streams from Java 8). In that case we can chain some functions that are non-terminal (they return Stream on which we can call another function) but those operations are not executed until we use a terminal function (like collect() that transforms Stream into some collection, like an array). Thus, all the operations (maps, filters etc.) are merged so that all of them can run in one loop.

On the other hand we have a JavaScript where we know that Array.prototype.map() returns another array, so it seems like each map() call is executed in separate loop. But that would be quite a waste of execution time! The simplest answer is that it's all optimized by engine so the functions are indeed executed in one loop, but I couldn't find any information that this is the case.

I have written this code but not able to group by for multiple columns.

List<CustomerBuildingMapping> objCustomerBuildingMappingResult = objTicketsForTheDayInfo.TicketsForTheDay.GroupBy(l => l.CustomerID).Select(grp => new CustomerBuildingMapping
            {
                CustomerID = grp.Key,
                //BuildingInfo = grp.Select(l => l.BuildingID).ToList(),
            }).ToList();
