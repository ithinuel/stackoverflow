<p>I feel like there has to be a way to make this consistent with AOT, but I'm not sure how. Should I be structuring my code in a different manner? Or do I have to abandon any prospect of DRY in this codebase to make it AOT-compatible?</p>

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-component-1',
  template: `<p>First Component</p>`
})
export class FirstComponent {}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-component-2',
  template: `<p>Second Component</p>`
})
export class SecondComponent {}

export const FooModule = makeModule('foo', [FirstComponent, SecondComponent]);

And here's the makeModule() function I'm trying to build:
import { NgModule, Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { Route, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

export const makeEntryComponent = (components: any[]) => {
  @Component({
    template: `<p>Entry Component</p>
      <ng-container *ngFor=""let component of components"">
        <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet=""component""></ng-container>
      </ng-container>
    `
  })
  class EntryComponent {
    components = components;
  }
  return EntryComponent;
};
export const makeModule = (componentName: string, components: any[]): any => {
  const EntryComponent = makeEntryComponent(components);
  const routes: Route[] = [{ path: componentName, component: EntryComponent }];
  const declarations = [EntryComponent, ...components];

  @NgModule({
    imports: [CommonModule, RouterModule.forChild(routes)],
    declarations,
    entryComponents: components,
    exports: [EntryComponent]
  })
  class Module {}
  return Module;
};

So this works fine using the JIT compiler, but as soon as I run ng serve --aot, it fails with:

ERROR in Error: Error encountered resolving symbol values statically. Function calls are not supported. Consider replacing the function or lambda with a reference to an exported function (position 18:27 in the original .ts file), resolving symbol makeModule in C:/Users/IGEN261/code/github/ng-dynamic/src/app/module-factory.ts, resolving symbol FooModule in C:/Users/IGEN261/code/github/ng-dynamic/src/app/foo.module.ts, resolving symbol FooModule in C:/Users/IGEN261/code/github/ng-dynamic/src/app/foo.module.ts, resolving symbol AppModule in C:/Users/IGEN261/code/github/ng-dynamic/src/app/app.module.ts, resolving symbol AppModule in C:/Users/IGEN261/code/github/ng-dynamic/src/app/app.module.ts

I feel like there has to be a way to make this consistent with AOT, but I'm not sure how. Should I be structuring my code in a different manner? Or do I have to abandon any prospect of DRY in this codebase to make it AOT-compatible?

I know how to use python  s email mime multipart MIMEMultipart class to create various kinds of multipart email messages  I have a need to do  email surgery  on certain existing multipart messages by taking the body  which contains the various MIME parts  and to remove and add some new parts without changing the rest of the email s headers  In the headers  there is the following sample header  Content Type  multipart mixed          boundary  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ       where the ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ boundary is used to separate the existing message parts  I want to use the email mime multipart MIMEMultipart tools to create a new body with modified parts  and I want to use the same ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ boundary between these parts  so that I don t have to go back and change the Content Type header that already exists among the message s original headers  It would be ideal if I could specify the exact text of the boundary that I want to use when creating this multipart body  but in python   it seems like the email mime multipart MIMEMultipart package always creates its own  randomly generated boundary string  In python   is there any way to tell the email mime multipart MIMEMultipart software to use a boundary string that I supply  If not  I can work around this by taking the newly generated message body  extracting its new boundary string  which I ll call  newboundary   and then replacing it with the original boundary  which I ll call  originalboundary    as follows  msgbodytext   msgbodytext replace newboundary  originalboundary   But I prefer not to do this  if possible  Any ideas about how to tell email mime multipart MIMEMultipart to use a boundary string that I specify  Thank you   Explicitly specifying the boundary in MIME multipart messages 	python-3.x	1811

</code></pre>

<p>I don't understand this. From my knowledge, OneWay and TwoWay only define in which direction the values are updated and not how often they can be updated.</p>

<p>I can not understand, that everything works fine with TwoWay, the business logic stays 100% the same and OneWay is a deal breaker.</p>

<p>If you ask yourself, why I want to know this: This binding was planned as a OneWay binding. It makes no sense to update the source in any way. I only changed it to TwoWay, because OneWay doesn't work as expected.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION with the help of @MikeStrobel: (see comments)</strong></p>

<p>The code needs be changed this way:</p>

<pre><code>private static void OnActiveNotesChanged(DependencyObject d, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e)
{
    Keyboard keyboard    = (Keyboard)d;

    //THIS LINE BREAKED THE CODE, WHEN USING OneWay binding BUT NOT WITH TwoWay binding
    //keyboard.ActiveNotes = (ReadOnlyCollection&lt;eNote&gt;)e.NewValue;

    if ((keyboard.ActiveNotes != null) &amp;&amp; (keyboard.ActiveNotes.Count &gt; 0))
    {
        keyboard.AllKeys.ForEach(k =&gt; { if ( k.Note != eNote.Undefined) k.IsActiveKey = true; });
        keyboard.AllKeys.ForEach(k =&gt; { if ((k.Note != eNote.Undefined) &amp;&amp; (!keyboard.ActiveNotes.Contains(k.Note))) k.IsActiveKey = false; });
    }
    else
    {
        keyboard.AllKeys.ForEach(k =&gt; { if (k.Note != eNote.Undefined) k.IsActiveKey = true; });
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using a OneWay binding, the assignment in the OnActiveNotesChanged event handler method deletes or clears out the binding. Mike is correct saying, that the assingment is completely unnecessary, because at this point of time the value is already set before in the property. So it makes no sense at all, no matter if I use OneWay or TwoWay binding.</p>

Just to make this complete, here is DP in the target object.

        ""ActiveNotes"",

}

private static void OnActiveNotesChanged(DependencyObject d, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e)

    Keyboard keyboard    = (Keyboard)d;
    keyboard.ActiveNotes = (ReadOnlyCollection<eNote>)e.NewValue;

    if ((keyboard.ActiveNotes != null) && (keyboard.ActiveNotes.Count > 0))
    {
        keyboard.AllKeys.ForEach(k => { if ( k.Note != eNote.Undefined) k.IsActiveKey = true; });
        keyboard.AllKeys.ForEach(k => { if ((k.Note != eNote.Undefined) && (!keyboard.ActiveNotes.Contains(k.Note))) k.IsActiveKey = false; });

I don't understand this. From my knowledge, OneWay and TwoWay only define in which direction the values are updated and not how often they can be updated.
I can not understand, that everything works fine with TwoWay, the business logic stays 100% the same and OneWay is a deal breaker.
If you ask yourself, why I want to know this: This binding was planned as a OneWay binding. It makes no sense to update the source in any way. I only changed it to TwoWay, because OneWay doesn't work as expected.
SOLUTION with the help of @MikeStrobel: (see comments)
The code needs be changed this way:
private static void OnActiveNotesChanged(DependencyObject d, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e)
{
    Keyboard keyboard    = (Keyboard)d;

    //THIS LINE BREAKED THE CODE, WHEN USING OneWay binding BUT NOT WITH TwoWay binding
    //keyboard.ActiveNotes = (ReadOnlyCollection<eNote>)e.NewValue;

    if ((keyboard.ActiveNotes != null) && (keyboard.ActiveNotes.Count > 0))
    {
        keyboard.AllKeys.ForEach(k => { if ( k.Note != eNote.Undefined) k.IsActiveKey = true; });
        keyboard.AllKeys.ForEach(k => { if ((k.Note != eNote.Undefined) && (!keyboard.ActiveNotes.Contains(k.Note))) k.IsActiveKey = false; });
    }
    else
    {
        keyboard.AllKeys.ForEach(k => { if (k.Note != eNote.Undefined) k.IsActiveKey = true; });
    }
}

Using a OneWay binding, the assignment in the OnActiveNotesChanged event handler method deletes or clears out the binding. Mike is correct saying, that the assingment is completely unnecessary, because at this point of time the value is already set before in the property. So it makes no sense at all, no matter if I use OneWay or TwoWay binding.
 WPF: TwoWay binding is ALWAYS updated - OneWay binding is ONLY ONCE updated"	I know what you think  It is       please don t come up with this again  but I really can not find any valueable explanation for this  Please have a look at the ActiveNotes property in this XAML Code  I have this TwoWay binding in my XAML  which works perfectly  It is ALWAYS updated  if the PropertyChanged event for ScaleNotes is fired and if the binding is set to TwoWay   c Keyboard              Grid Row                  Grid Column                  PlayCommand   Binding PlayCommand                StopCommand   Binding StopCommand                ActiveNotes   Binding ScaleNotes  Mode TwoWay  UpdateSourceTrigger PropertyChanged      The ScaleNotes property in the ViewModel looks like this  Whenever it changes  the PropertyChanged event is guaranteed to be fired  I checked and double checked it  The business logic in the ViewModel works  private ReadOnlyCollection eNote   ScaleNotes  public ReadOnlyCollection eNote  ScaleNotes       get   return  ScaleNotes        set   SetField ref  ScaleNotes  value         DebuggerStepThrough  protected virtual void OnPropertyChanged

to here everything is ok  Whenever the ScaleNotes property in the VM is changed  the target property ActiveNotes is updated  Now the problem  If I only change the binding in the XAML to OneWay and the business logic in the VM stays      the same  the ActivesNotes property in the target object is updated only once even if the PropertyChanged event is fired  I checked and double checked it  The PropertyChanged event for the ScaleNotes property is always fired   c Keyboard              Grid Row                  Grid Column                  PlayCommand   Binding PlayCommand

 How to inject ClaimsPrincipal in Nancy"	I have a Nancy module and a decorator class that needs to know the ClaimsPrincipal in order to retrieve the user s email address  So I have declared a constructor as public EmailDecorator IDbConnectionFactory connectionFactory                        IPrincipal principal                        IEmailClient emailClient    base connectionFactory   What I m struggling to figure out is how to inject the principal into the constructor  I m using Simple Injector for DI and it has been very effective  But if I override the ConfigureRequestContainer   method  which has as a parameter for the NancyContext  to instantiate IPrincipal I get an exception protected override void ConfigureRequestContainer      TinyIoCContainer container  NancyContext context        container Register IPrincipal   c  o     context CurrentUser        base ConfigureRequestContainer container  context      The exception indicates Simple Injector doesn t know about IPrincipal which is registered in the default TinyIOC container   The configuration is invalid  Creating the instance for type InvoiceModule failed  The constructor of type EmailDecorator contains the parameter with name  principal  and type IPrincipal that is not registered  Please ensure IPrincipal is registered  or change the constructor of EmailDecorator   Edit I ve spent way too long trying to resolve this and I suspect the answer is to stop trying to do it this way  In my original example  I m trying to inject IPrincipal into the decorator constructor which is incorrect  Instead I need to inject some form of service that allows me to derive IPrincipal when one of the methods in the decorator is called  e g  Func IPrincipal   Nancy provides an override able method ConfigureRequestContainer   that is called for each request  so could potentially be used  protected override void ConfigureRequestContainer TinyIoCContainer container  NancyContext context        container Register Func IPrincipal    c  o                   return       context CurrentUser             Except that the request container is a TinyIoCContainer and I m using SimpleInjector  So  maybe I can add a SimpleInjector registration that offloads resolution to the request container   container RegisterSingleton Func IPrincipal         nancy Resolve Func IPrincipal        Actually no  nancy is not the same container as the request container  So maybe somewhere there is a container that can successfully resolve IPrincipal but I do not know how to access it  The objective of the exercise was to avoid having to modify the method signatures of the repo code to include the ClaimsPrincipal  kind of like the old days when it was possible to call Thread CurrentPrincipal  Still looking for a clue but will start modifying the method signature to include a ClaimsPrincipal   How to inject ClaimsPrincipal in Nancy	c#	2841

"	Order Results by Priority & Group Values & then filter results	node.js|amazon-web-services|amazon-dynamodb|serverless-framework	"Here is my DynamoDB current data:

My goal is to create a query which filters the result in the Group Set (to like ""Default"") , and then sorts by priority and then filters the results to those where loggedIn == true and status == idle.
In SQL it would be something like
SELECT *

  AND loggedIn == true AND status == ""idle"" 
ORDER BY priority DESC

How would I create a query to do this?

<p>Given a sorted array of integers I believe one can determine the subset of those integers that line between an upper and lower bound in ~O(log(n)).

<p>An approximation better than O(log(n)) after some precomputing. Suppose we're dealing with only 1D (then we can generalize to 3D). Quantize the space of each axis then create a hash table with the following structure. For each unit in the quantized space, store the index position of the first point in the sorted array with that unit +- error value. Then given an upper and lower bound, round each to the nearest quantized unit and look up the values for those keys to identify the range of index positions within the span. This returns a list.

My question is: Is there any guidlines I can follow to know when there is a need to use queues or not because I cant find this information anywhere. I realise apple provides example usage howver it is very vague
 When are GCD queues used and when do you know you need them? Swift"	After reading about Concurrent and Serial queues  sync and async  I think I have an idea about how to create queues and the order they are executed in  My problem is that in any of the tutorials I have seen  none of them actually tell you many use cases  For example  I have a network manager that uses URLSessions and serializes json to send a request to my api  Does it make sense to wrap it in a  utility Queue or in a  userInitiated or do I just don t wrap it in a queue   let task   LoginTask username  username  password  password   let networkQueue   DispatchQueue label   com messenger network    qos  DispatchQoS userInitiated   networkQueue async       task dataTask in  dispatcher     user  httpCode  error  in         self presenter  loginUserResponse user  user  httpCode  httpCode  error  error           My question is  Is there any guidlines I can follow to know when there is a need to use queues or not because I cant find this information anywhere  I realise apple provides example usage howver it is very vague  When are GCD queues used and when do you know you need them  Swift	swift	1098

"	Creating a border animation on circle	jquery|css|svg	"
I want to animate the middle circle's borders to start off with nothing and rotate to complete the circle (classes .cir3 & .cir4) almost like a spinner(page loader) without the repeating.

Fiddle 
I changed them to black so they are easy to identify.
Here is a close example(bottom row) of what I'm looking for except I want it to complete the circle and not repeat like this
I just need someone to point me the right direction.
JS Fiddle is Cleaner code.

with the extra field  so I inherit from the AccountValidator class  As you can see  I get this slippery slope of messy  inherited classes that only serve the purpose of adding one or two fields  logic to all the classes that should be able to handle them generically at some point  I mean  that s the purpose of polymorphism  right  So that I can use Account all over the place and the services  etc   just work   Is there somewhere in this tangled mess that the adapter pattern would work  Thanks in advance for any advice   How to handle inheritance of Spring Beans in MVC projects	java	5060

"	How to design a complex class which incude some classes to make expansion easily in future in Kotlin?	java|kotlin	"I'm a beginner of Kotlin, I use Code A to define a complex class MDetail, and use Code B to create a object aMDetail1, it can work.
But the data construction  is too bad to expand, if I include a new data class such as ScreenDef in MDetail  just like Code C, all old code have to be rewriten.
Is there a good data construction for a complex class which include some classes ? I hope to the data construction can be expansion easily in future!
